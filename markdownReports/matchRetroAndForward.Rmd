3 options for observed data

1.  Trimmed to time series that are full (~20 years with all 18 CUs)
2.  Model outputs from Sean's TMB analysis
3.  Calculated values with subset of CUs using `calcSynchMetrics` function

Option 1 will inflate synchrony relative to retro because only high period is being sampled; similar pattern with CVc but less dramatic. Option 2 and 3 should provide equivalent results to retrospective unless uncertainty can be incorporated. 

More fundamental question is why CVc in particular is so depressed relative to forward simulated reference values. Double check and confirm
